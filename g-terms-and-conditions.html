                                <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
                                <p>
                                    By accessing or using the KitchenSync application (“App”), you signify that you have
                                    read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms").
                                    These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement (“Agreement”) between you and
                                    KitchenSync Technologies Inc. (“KitchenSync,” “we,” “us” or “our”), and apply to all
                                    visitors, users, and others who access the App (“Users”).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Please read these Terms carefully. They outline your legal rights and obligations
                                    and include important disclaimers and choices of law and forum for resolving
                                    disputes. By using the App, you agree to comply with these Terms. If you do not
                                    agree with any part of these Terms, you may not use the App.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and
                                    compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others
                                    who access or use the App. If you access the App on behalf of a company, principal,
                                    or other entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such entity and its
                                    affiliates to these Terms and that it is fully binding on them. In such case, the
                                    term “you” will refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have
                                    authority, you may not access or use the App.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions
                                    of these Terms at any time. Please check these Terms and any Guidelines periodically
                                    for changes. Your continued use of the App after the posting of changes constitutes
                                    your binding acceptance of such changes. For any material changes to these Terms, we
                                    will make reasonable effort to provide notice to you of such amended Terms, such as
                                    by an email notification to the address associated with your account or by posting a
                                    notice on the App, and such amended terms will be effective against you on the
                                    earlier of (i) your actual notice of them and (ii) thirty days after they are
                                    provided to you. Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance
                                    with the version of these Terms that was in effect at the time the dispute arose.
                                </p>

                                    We also reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue the App or any part
                                    thereof at any time without notice or liability to you. You acknowledge that the

                                    may not necessarily continue uninterrupted or without technical or other errors and
                                    KitchenSync shall not be responsible to you or others for any such interruptions,
                                    errors, or problems or an outright discontinuance of the App.

                                <h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                                <p>In the event of a dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the
                                    Application, the parties shall endeavor to resolve the dispute through amicable
                                    negotiations. If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within thirty
                                    (30) days, either party may request mediation. If mediation fails to resolve the
                                    dispute, the parties agree that the dispute shall be referred to and finally
                                    resolved by binding arbitration under the rules of Dubai International Arbitration
                                    Centre (DIAC), which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this
                                    clause. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The
                                    language of the arbitration shall be English. The decision of the arbitrator shall
                                    be final and binding upon the parties.</p>

                                <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
                                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of United Arab Emirates., without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to
                                    enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                                    those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable
                                    by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.</p>

                                <h2>16. Corrections and Updates</h2>
                                <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any
                                    time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to
                                    any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined
                                    at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Application after those
                                    revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do
                                    not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Application.</p>
