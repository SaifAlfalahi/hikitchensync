                            <h4>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>
                            <p><span class="d-inline">In Short:</span> We retain personal information for as long as
                                necessary to provide the services requested by you, or for other essential purposes such
                                as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our policies.
                            </p>
                            <p>Our retention periods for personal information are based on business needs and legal
                                requirements. We retain personal information for as long as is necessary for the
                                processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other
                                permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and
                                correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired,
                                or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. When
                                personal information is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymize the data (in
                                which case we may further retain and use the anonymized information) or securely destroy
                                the data.</p>
                            <h4>HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h4>
                            <p><span class="d-inline">In Short:</span> We aim to protect your personal information
                                through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
                            <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to secure

                                alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on
                                you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain
                                parts of our Apps, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask
                                you not to share your password with anyone.</p>
                            <p>Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information
                                transmitted through our Apps or over the internet. Any transmission of personal
                                information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy

                            <p>We apply the following measures to ensure data security:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Encryption of data in transit and at rest.</li>
                                <li>Regular cybersecurity assessments and penetration testing of our systems.</li>
                                <li>Training our staff on data security and privacy protection.</li>
                                <li>Implementing access controls to ensure only necessary personnel have access to your
                                    personal information.</li>
                                <li>Using reputable and secure cloud hosting services to manage our data storage.</li>

                            <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By

                                collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
